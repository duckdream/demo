# Common Tasks

This document outlines common administrative tasks.

## Creating a Game Account

To create a new game account, you need to attach to the `ac-worldserver` container and use the server's command-line interface.

1.  Attach to the world server console:
    ```bash
    docker attach ac-worldserver
    ```

2.  Create the account:
    ```
    account create <username> <password>
    ```

3.  (Optional) Set GM level for the account. A level of 3 is for an administrator.
    ```
    account set gmlevel <username> 3 -1
    ```

4.  Detach from the console by pressing `Ctrl+P` followed by `Ctrl+Q`.
