# Deployment

This project is deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. The services are defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file (as described in the `[README.md](mdc:README.md)`).

## Services

There are four main services:

1.  **`ac-database`**: The MySQL database server.
2.  **`ac-db-import`**: A one-time service that initializes the database. It depends on `ac-database`.
3.  **`ac-authserver`**: The authentication server. It depends on `ac-database` being healthy and `ac-db-import` completing successfully.
4.  **`ac-worldserver`**: The world server. It also depends on `ac-database` and `ac-db-import`.

## Startup Order

The services are started in a specific order to ensure dependencies are met:
1.  `ac-database` starts first.
2.  `ac-db-import` runs after the database is healthy.
3.  `ac-authserver` and `ac-worldserver` start after the database is ready and the import is complete.

For detailed information about the services, ports, and volumes, please refer to the `[README.md](mdc:README.md)`.
