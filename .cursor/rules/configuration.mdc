# Configuration

The main configuration for the services is handled through a combination of environment files and `.conf` files.

## Environment Configuration

*   `[conf/dist/env.ac](mdc:conf/dist/env.ac)`: This file defines environment variables that are used by the Docker services. It sets up things like database connection info, and directories for logs and data.

## Server Configuration

The configuration files for the `authserver` and `worldserver` are located in `[env/dist/etc/](mdc:env/dist/etc)`.

*   `[env/dist/etc/authserver.conf](mdc:env/dist/etc/authserver.conf)`: Configuration for the authentication server.
*   `[env/dist/etc/worldserver.conf](mdc:env/dist/etc/worldserver.conf)`: Configuration for the world server. The `README.md` states that this file is the main one that requires modification for deployment.

For multi-realm deployments, separate `worldserver.conf` files are created for each realm (e.g., `s1_worldserver.conf`, `s2_worldserver.conf`).
